# LaTeX-Works
This repository stores almost all of my works with LaTeX.

I am new to LaTeX so most of my works are unprofessional.

If you want to learn LaTeX, here are some sources I would strongly suggest:

1. [The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX2Îµ](https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf) by [Tobias Oetiker](https://github.com/oetiker), it is also available in other languages [here](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort)
2. [LaTeX Beginner's Guide by Stefan Kottwitz](http://static.latexstudio.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/LaTeX_Beginners_Guide.pdf), if the first link is dead, [click here](https://github.com/tachithanhdanh/LaTeX-Works/blob/main/documents/LaTeX_Beginners_Guide.pdf)
3. [Stackoverflow-LaTeX's version](https://tex.stackexchange.com/)
4. [LaTeX Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX)
5. [Overleaf LaTeX's Tutorial](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials)
6. [Detexify - A place to look up symbols](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html)
7. [Evan Chen LaTeX FAQ's](https://web.evanchen.cc/faq-latex.html)
