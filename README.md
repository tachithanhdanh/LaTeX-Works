# LaTeX-Works
This repository stores almost all of my works with LaTeX.

I am new to LaTeX so most of my works are unprofessional.

If you want to learn LaTeX, here are some sources I would strongly suggest:

1. [The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX2Îµ](https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf), it is also available in other languages [here](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/?lang=en)
2. [Stackoverflow-LaTeX's version](https://tex.stackexchange.com/)
